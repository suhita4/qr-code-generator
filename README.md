# QR Code Generato
QR Code Generator using JavaScript

QR (Quick Response) codes are capable of storing lots of data, and users can easily access the information by scanning the QR code. In this project I have made it so that the users can paste in an URL of their choice or just text and generate a QR code for the same. I have used the qrserver API in order to convert the user input into QR code.
